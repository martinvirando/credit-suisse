# Martin Virando Test.

To run the app you'll need firstly use these commands:

`
npm install
npm start
`
## Description

In my application the user is able to apply filters so they can drill down to the orders they would like to check. On initial load the items are ordered by count so they would be able to see which items are the most popular.

## Libraries

I used react / redux in this test as I want one local state to reun all the filtering. I have also used underscore to help with crunching the data.

## Things I would have liked to add if I had more time and in production.

If I had more time I would have unit tested everything but due to limited time I could only make unit tests for a few components. I also would have combined items with same attributes but different dates so users would have seen a smaller more consise data set.

In production I would either create an API that delievers the results and handles pagination and searching or I would handle this better on the front end. I would have ensured I spent the time with users researching what they are looking for the application and would have created A / B test components that would have provided more to the company.

I made an assumption that the user would look through the returned data as a list but if I were to run this again I would have combined the data to a smaller set or create pagination.
